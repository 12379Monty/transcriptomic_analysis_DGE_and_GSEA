Differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis

This file consists of loading the bulk-transcriptome data and differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, including

1) load series and platform data from GEO
2) log2 transform
3) DGE by limma
4) heatmap
5) Gene set enrichment analyses

The input: GEO accession id

The output figures: Figure 4f, Figure 6b
